# AI Architecture Assistant

An innovative solution developed for the Azure AI Developer Hackathon that helps developers and architects design, visualize, and implement cloud architectures using AI.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Architecture Design**: AI-powered architecture recommendations with best practices
- **Visual Diagrams**: Interactive architecture diagrams with component relationships
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost breakdowns and optimization suggestions
- **IaC Generation**: Terraform code generation for infrastructure deployment
- **Security Features**: Built-in security best practices and compliance checks
- **Export Options**: Export designs as PowerPoint or PDF documentation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Azure OpenAI API access
- Azure B2C tenant (for authentication)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key

# Azure B2C Configuration
VITE_AZURE_B2C_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_AZURE_B2C_AUTHORITY=https://your-tenant.b2clogin.com/your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com/policy-name
VITE_AZURE_B2C_KNOWN_AUTHORITY=https://your-tenant.b2clogin.com
VITE_AZURE_B2C_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
